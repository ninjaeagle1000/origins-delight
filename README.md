# origins-delight
A compatability mod for Farmer's Delight, Farmer's Knives, Expanded Delight, Origins, and Extra Origins.  It makes any food whose recipe includes meat edible by carivores and adds golden knifes, rose gold knifes, netherite knifes, and gilden netherite knifes to the appropriate piglin tags.

This is basically a datapack in a jar file.
